/*
Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative integer, twoâ€™s complement method is used.

Note:

All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase.
The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s. If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0'; 
otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You must not use any method provided by the library which converts/formats the number to hex directly.

Example 1:
Input:
26
Output:
"1a"
*/

// first pass solution
var toHex = function(num) {
    if (num === 0) return '0';
    if (num < 0) num += 2**32;
    
    let chars = '0123456789abcdef';
    let output = '';
    
    while (num) {
        let digit = num % 16;
        output = chars[digit] + output;
        num = Math.floor(num / 16);
    }
    return output;
};
