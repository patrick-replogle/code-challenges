/*
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest 
node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Example 1:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

var lowestCommonAncestor = function(root, p, q) {
    if (!root) return null;
    
    if (root.val === p.val || root.val === q.val) {
        return root;
    }
    let left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
    let right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
    
    if (left && right) return root;
    return left || right;
}
