// When you recently visited your little nephew, he told you a sad story: there's a bully at school who steals his lunch every day, and 
// locks it away in his locker. He also leaves a note with a strange, coded message. Your nephew gave you one of the notes in hope that 
// you can decipher it for him. And you did: it looks like all the digits in it are replaced with letters and vice versa. Digit 0 is 
// replaced with 'a', 1 is replaced with 'b' and so on, with digit 9 replaced by 'j'.

// The note is different every day, so you decide to write a function that will decipher it for your nephew on an ongoing basis.

// Example

// For note = "you'll n4v4r 6u4ss 8t: cdja", the output should be
// stolenLunch(note) = "you'll never guess it: 2390".

function stolenLunch(note) {
    let result = "";   
    let dict = {
        "a": "0",
        "b": "1",
        "c": "2",
        "d": "3",
        "e": "4",
        "f": "5",
        "g": "6",
        "h": "7",
        "i": "8",
        "j": "9",
